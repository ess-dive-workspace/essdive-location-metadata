# ESS-DIVE Reporting Format for location metadata v1.0.1

## About the reporting format
ESS-DIVE's location reporting format is intended to guide users in providing a minimal set of metadata about locations.

This reporting format was developed by synthesizing the requirements for reporting locations from ESS-DIVE's existing reporting formats. We also took into consideration 12 other locations-related standards, conventions, guidelines, and reporting formats to determine which elements would constitute a minimal set of appropriate metadata.

## Quickstart Guide
  1. **Read** reporting format [instructions](instructions.md) to understand how to fill out templates.
  2. **Review** our [terminology guide](term_list/guide.md) to understand definitions of each term used in the templates.
  3. **Download** blank copy of [reporting format template](templates)
  4. **Save** your completed locations metadata template as a CSV file and upload to ESS-DIVE as part of your dataset.

## Updates in v1.0.1
In March 2025, a patch version of the Location Metadata reporting format was made to improve the overall experience with the associated reporting format documentation. Additionally, the standard reporting format keyword and standard term were added to the instructions.md file.
