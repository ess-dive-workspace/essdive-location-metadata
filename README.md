# ESS-DIVE Reporting Format for location metadata v 1.0.0

## About the reporting format
ESS-DIVE's locations reporting format is intended to guide users in providing a minimal set of metadata about locations.

This reporting format was developed by synthesizing the requirements for reporting locations from ESS-DIVE's existing reporting formats. We also took into consideration 12 other locations-related standards, conventions, guidelines, and reporting formats to determine which elements would constitute a minimal set of appropriate metadata.

## Quickstart Guide
  1. **Read** reporting format [instructions](instructions.md) to understand how to fill out templates.
  2. **Download** blank copy of [reporting format template](https://github.com/ess-dive-community/essdive-location-metadata/tree/main/templates)
  4. **Save** your completed locations metadata template as a CSV file and upload to ESS-DIVE as part of your dataset.

## How to contribute
